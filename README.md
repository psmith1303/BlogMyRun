# BlogMyRun

This programme:

1. Gets a list of all runs from SmashRun
2. For each run, it creates a Hugo compatible blog file (YAML header, Markdown body).
3. Includes a Google static map to the run

The format of the "blog entries" is determined by a [jinja2
template](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/), so if your layout does
not quite match mine you can change it.

A SVG polyline of the run is included in the YAML header of the blog entry, as 'runsvg'.

## Installation

### Requirements

You will need the `jinja2`  html templating system. I install it like this:

	sudo pip install jinja2

### Configuration

To access the SmashRun API you will need to get a token. For now, I
use the [SmashRun API Explorer](https://api.smashrun.com/v1/explorer),
and get the token for 'client' (which happens to be me, and will be
you if you do it yourself).

There is an option for little icon that needs to exist on the web
somewhere. It is used as a marker on the Google map to mark the start
of the run. You might like to change it to be something else.
Otherwise, a default marker will be used.

If you are not using Hugo, or you want a different layout of the blog
post, you should tweak the file `BlogMyRun.markdown` in the template
directory.

## Usage

BlogMyRun.py           # Converts runs done in the last day

BlogMyRun.py -d 7      # Converts runs done in the last 7 days

BlogMyRun.py -p 2      # Converts page 2 of 100 activities; you can step
                         through all the activities this way

BlogMyRun.py -a        # Converts all the runs from SmashRun; if you hit
                         limits, do it a page (100 activities) at a time, 
				         use -p
					
BlogMyRun.py -i  10976 #  Converts run with ID 10976

BlogMyRun.py -n        # Convert all the runs from SmashRun since the last
                         time the application was used. If the application
                         has not been used before, it will try and get all
                         the since year zero !
						 
BlogMyRun.py -a -w 60  # Wait 60 seconds between getting each activity to avoid
	                     hitting SmashRun's API limits (for user logins).

BlogMyRun.py -m "https://goo.gl/5y3S82" # use the icon at the URL as
the marker on the maps

BlogMyRun.py -v        # Be verbose, -v 3 be more verbose

## To do.
	
1. For each month, create a macro-log comparing this month with
   previous months and previous year
2. Add proper OAUTH2 authentication, so the script can work for
   anyone.
